    "  1. Uniformity of Cell Size, Uniformity of Cell Shape, and Bare Nuclei are the biggest drivers of malignancy. \n",
    "  2. A physician can focus more on the three important features when examining a patient, or use the random forest model I built to screen patients more efficiently. \n",
    "  3. Since uniformity of cell size and uniformity of cell shape are highly correlated, we only need to select one feature to measure. Then measure marginal adhesion and bare nuclei. "
